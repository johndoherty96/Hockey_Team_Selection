<h1>Hockey Team Selection Based on User Specified Country and Position</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves creating a shapefile of all professional hockey players globally and a shapefile containing country boundaries. The script was developed and executed in Pyscripter, with the results displayed in ArcGIS Pro. The script allows users to filter players by country and position. Additionally, it adds two new fields to the attribute table, calculating metric measurements for height and weight.
